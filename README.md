# Dream Drive

DreamDrive is a web-based AI studio where users upload photos of their car and place it anywhere in the world. DreamDrive lets users “capture” a Street View snapshot from Google Maps, providing rich, realistic background context for their shot. The system then generates high-quality, cinematic images of their car in that chosen real-world scene.
